# Getting and Cleaning Data Project

This is the final project for the 'Getting Cleaning Data' course. It contains a single script (run_analysis.R), and assumes that the dataset was unzipped on the same directory. After 'sourcing' the file on R, you can run the function ```run.analysis``` to get the new dataset.

## Steps to work on this cource project
1. Download and unzip the datasource file.
2. Download run_analysis.R in the parent folder. Set the working
   directory on R properly (use ```setwd()``` if required).
3. Type ```source("run_analysis.R)``` and hit ```ENTER```.

## Dependencies

This projects depends on library ```reshape```.
