Getting and Cleaning Data. Final Project
========================================

This is the final project for Getting Cleaning Data. It contains a single script (run_analysis.R), and assumes that the dataset was unzipped on the same directory. After 'sourcing' the file on R, you can run the function 'run.analysis' to get the new dataset.
