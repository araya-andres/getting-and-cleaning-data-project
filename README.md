Getting and Cleaning Data. Final Project
========================================

This is the final project for Getting Cleaning Data. It contains a single file (run_analysis.R), and assumes that the dataset was unzipped on the same directory. After 'sourcing' the file, you can run the function 'run.analysis' to get the new dataset.

The code is roughly organized as the project description.
